*NAME*: BURRA VAISHNAVI

*INTERN ID*: CT04DM713

*DOMAIN*: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

*DESCRIPTION*: I have performed AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP task.

               Tools used for this code:

                     Python (Programming Language and Interpreter): This is the core language the code is written in and the interpreter (python.exe) is what executes the code.
                     
                     NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): This is a Python library specifically designed for natural language processing tasks. 
                     
                     i have used NLTK's Chat module and utilities like nltk.data.find() and nltk.download() for managing linguistic data and creating the conversational logic.
                     
                     Command Prompt (CMD): This is the command-line interface used to execute the Python script.
                     
                     VS Code (Visual Studio Code) : It is text editor used to write and edit the Python code file.

              Use cases: 


                    Learning and Education: It's an excellent basic example for understanding how simple rule-based chatbots work and how to use the NLTK library for conversational AI.
                    
                    This is a common starting point for learning NLP.
                    
                    Simple Q&A Systems: For very narrow and predictable domains where responses can be hardcoded based on specific keywords or patterns.
                    
                    Basic Interactive Demonstrations: To showcase a concept or engage users in a very limited conversational manner.
                    
                    Text Processing Tasks: While this specific code is a chatbot, the underlying NLTK library is broadly used for various text processing tasks such as:
                    
                    Tokenization: Breaking text into words or sentences.
                    
                    Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form.
                    
                    Part-of-Speech Tagging: Identifying the grammatical role of words.
                    
                    Sentiment Analysis (more advanced NLTK use): Determining the emotional tone of text.
